Numbers like weight and length are therefore very natural features, but we can use features such as \"Ability to fly\" by setting a value to 0 for birds that don't fly and to 1 for birds that do. We call this type of feature a categorical value (because it splits the data into categories of flying and nonflying bords) or sometimes binary features (because it has exactly two possible values). As you have seen in the above exercises we can describe the color of the wings with RGB creating three numerical features from 0 to 1. "
