    "\n",
    "This notebook will introduce you to word-embeddings. An embedding is essentially a vector-representation for some object or concept - in this case words. Word embeddings can be trained to create these vector for a given vocabulary, and the vectors can then be used by other systems for performing AI-tasks. Word embeddings is an ongoing field of research and many new ideas appear every year.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The specific type of word embeddings which we will use here is called fastText and has been developed by Facebook. They \n",
    "have pretrained embeddings freely available, so we do not need to train them ourselves, but we can simply download theirs and work from there.\n",

    "We will now look at a ton of word-vectors. The vectors are in 300 dimensions! This is way too many dimensions for a human to visualize geometrically. We can though compute something called a Principle Component Analysis (PCA). You will later learn a ton about this method, but in short terms it allows us to find the few dimensions with the most variance in (the most movement of the vectors and the most \"action\" to see). If we take the 3 dimensions with the most variance we can plot them in a 3D plot!  \n",
