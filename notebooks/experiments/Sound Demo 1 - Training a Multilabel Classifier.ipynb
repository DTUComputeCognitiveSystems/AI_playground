    "# Binary classifier\n",
    "We are going to use a pretrained model to construct a binary sound classifier. The model is a deep convolutional nerual network in the same style as the [VGG16 network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf), with slightly different settings and fewer layers. The VGG16 network was originally used for images so how can we use it for sound? Instead of working directly with the waveform signal we can work with the spectrogram, a 2d image, instead.  \n",
    "The pretraining was done on the [UrbanSound8K dataset](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html).  This contains more than 8000 examples up to 4 seconds long of sound from 10 different classes (children playing, dogs barking among others). Our hope is that the network has learnt some general audio-features from the spetrogram, that we can use to distinguish between two classes of sound of your choice.  \n",
